        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            Fossils (ফসিল্‌স) is an Indian hard rock band from Bengal formed in Kolkata, West Bengal, India in 1998. The group is considered one of the pioneering 
            rock acts in Kolkata's Bengali music scene. The band currently comprises Rupam Islam (lead vocals, additional guitars), Deep Ghosh (rhythm guitar), 
            Allan Temjen Ao (lead guitar), Tanmoy Das (drums), Prasenjit 'Pom' Chakraborty (bass guitar).
            <br><br>
            Their music is flavoured by a blend of blues, rock and psychedelia, along with Rupam Islam's vocal renditions of his characteristic psychoanalytical 
            lyrics. They are noted for their social commentary and advocation of causes such as the welfare of HIV positive people.
            <br><br>
            The band was formed by Rupam Islam, the vocalist. Their first stage show was held on 9 January 1999 at Najrul Mancha for Gaan 99 organised by HMV. While 
            performing on stage as Rupam Islam and group, on that very day Rupam announced that henceforth he will perform as Fossils. This show had Deep on acoustic 
            guitar, Deep Ghosh on guitars, Tanmoy on bass, Rajiv on drums and Rupam. This line up was short lived and the very next show saw Chandra and Teno on guitars, 
            Baji on drums, Bumpy on bass, Jatu on keyboards and Rupam.

            The group started to call themselves "Fossils" after a suggestion by their guitarist Deep. The name is inspired by a line from one of Rupam's lyrics: 
            "Khoro aamar fossil, onubhutir michhil protikriashil kono biplobe".
            <br><br>
            Initial audience reaction to the band's music was not encouraging. During their first few shows, they met with jeering and hostile objection to the rock 
            style and techniques they employed.[1]
            <br><br>
            Thus, the band name was meant to convey a sense of an "underground" movement that the members felt they had initiated and their belief that they would 
            be fossilised into history under the pressure of social disapproval of their music, only to be excavated decades later by musicologists wishing to discover 
            the roots of Bengali rock.
